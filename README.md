#4910 Scheduling Application Project
## Synopsis
This code repository is for a web application that is designed to make scheduling group meeting times for academics faster and easier.

## Code Example
TO COME

## Motivation
After conducting a cognitive task analysis, we confirmed that students have difficulty making group schedules quickly. In order to avoid unecessary time spent on discussing when people can/cannot meet, we seek to automate this by running an algorthim over people's schedules that they have already created (or have been created for them). Ideally this will make finding group meeting times a cinch!
